 * counts rendered frames, so a 1080i25 feed reads 50: 50 motion samples a second, which
 * for sport is as smooth as 50p, so it ranks with them. A lower reading (shorter picture
 * or fewer fps) lowers a fresh one only once seen on two different days ([Meta.low] holds
 * the first), so one zap onto a passing fallback or 25 fps slate doesn't demote a good
 * feed; a reading as good in between starts over. A demotion keeps the audio (it's about
 * the picture). (Event feeds keep their marker's tier however low they read.)
