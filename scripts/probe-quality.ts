// Probe REAL video metadata (resolution/fps/codec) for the channels that CLAIM
// >=1080p (marker tier q>=4: FHD/RAW/UHD/8K) and cache it, so curation can sort on
// truth instead of the provider's lying "UHD"/"RAW" tags. We skip the ~880 feeds
// whose markers already say <1080p (HD/SD/unmarked) — no point probing those.
//
// Fast + low-overhead: ffprobe reads only stream headers (SPS/VPS) with a tiny
// -probesize and exits (no decode → CPU near-idle). Concurrency is capped to the
// subscription's currently-free slots; exceeding that limit makes every stream
// return HTTP 458 and can interrupt normal viewing.
//
// RESUMABLE + PROGRESSIVE: loads the existing cache and skips anything already
// probed, and flushes the cache to disk atomically every ~2s (and at the end), so
// killing it mid-run never costs more than a couple seconds of work.
//
// REFRESH MODE (`refresh` arg): re-probe ONLY feeds not yet confirmed at their marker
// tier — those missing a reading (dead ones weekly), or cached BELOW their stated quality
// (e.g. a "3840p" feed reading 1080p, probably idle and may return higher). Feeds already at/above their
// marker are left alone — nothing to gain. Retry event-only feeds (live only during a match); OVERWRITE a cached reading
// only when strictly better (height, then fps) — monotonic, so an idle/lower probe never
// downgrades a known peak. Repeated runs thus chase the gaps and converge on each peak.
//
// RE-VERIFICATION: a peak can go stale — a feed's source changes, or an adaptive restream
// was caught at its best moment once — and the monotonic rule would keep it forever. So
// every reading carries the day it was taken (`at`), and refresh first re-probes readings
// older than STALE_DAYS (in playlist order), REPLACING them with what the feed shows now. A
// below-marker result is chased back up by the gap pass on later runs; PPV/event feeds
// are floored at their marker by realRes in api/_lib.ts, so an idle re-probe can't bury them.
// A re-probe with NO signal proves nothing (dead feed, or a refused connection): the
// reading stays due, and `tried` only moves it to the back of the queue so dead feeds
// don't eat every night's budget.
//
// BUSY SLOT: a probe that finds no signal waits for the run's own connection to drop off,
// then checks the account (and retries the feed once if the slot is free); if the one slot
// is taken, someone started watching, so the run stops at once instead of
// recording their channel-switches as dead feeds.
//
// TIME BUDGET (`mins=N`, default 30): stop starting new probes once the budget is spent.
// Refresh targets are by definition the feeds that DIDN'T reach their marker — idle or
// dead ones that burn the full ffprobe timeout — and at the one connection this account
// allows, the ~900-feed backlog is several hours of wall clock. Unbounded, that either
// blows GitHub's 6h job limit or holds the only connection slot all day. Bounded, each
// run takes a predictable bite and the monotonic cache keeps the progress.
